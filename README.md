# Twittascope

The Twittascope gem scrapes the horoscopes of all 12 zodiac signs as well as a zodiac reading 'for everyone'.

Instead of clicking through multiple links on twittascope.com, the horoscope will load in mere seconds right before you need to carry on your day!  

Each horoscope sign has a yesterday, today, and tomorrow reading of your fortune.  Each reading ends with a insightful quote.
